### Project Overview
##### Analyze MTA data for a period of time and develop analyses on the data
###### As of January 27, 2021, we have gathered and analyzed at least 3 weeks worth of data on MTA buses, constantly accessing all of MTA's bus information every 3 minutes.

### Project Goals
###### Show data to help the Straphangers Campaign advocate for better and more equitable public transit service in NYC
