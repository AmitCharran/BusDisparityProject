## Current Task
### I'm splitting everything up into two parts. 
- Database testing
- API testing

#### The goal with these two parts is to create and use the database properly.The goal of API testing is essentially the same. Then we reconvene and create a working project that will do exactly what we want.

### Roles so far:
- Database testing
  - Alvin
  - Carina
  - Ariel 
- API testing
  - Amit
  - Joshua

### **Important: ** 
#### While working on these parts please leave helpful comments for everyone else in the group. It will be a little bit of extra work for you, but it will save everyone else a lot of time.
