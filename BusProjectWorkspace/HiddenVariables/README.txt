There is a file in here called hidden_variables.py

This file is in the git ignore file and it holds things like the API Access Key.

This will also include file_paths so you can customize your own outputs to your own computer.

Just message me(Amit) if you need this file on your computer.
Also remember to add it to your .gitignore

variables include:
MTA_API_KEY
